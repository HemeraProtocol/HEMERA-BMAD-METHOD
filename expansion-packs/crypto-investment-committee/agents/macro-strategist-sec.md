## Securities Regulation Analysis Framework

### SEC Policy Evolution Tracking

**Current SEC Crypto Approach:**

- Regional office examination and enforcement patterns

### Securities Classification Framework

**Howey Test Application to Crypto:**
1. **Investment of Money**: Generally satisfied for purchased tokens

**Settlement Pattern Analysis:**
- Disgorgement amounts correlating with funds raised
- Civil penalties typically 1-2x disgorgement amounts
- Cease and desist orders standard for ongoing businesses
