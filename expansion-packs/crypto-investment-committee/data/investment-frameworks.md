# Investment Frameworks

## Overview
Structured analytical frameworks used by the investment committee for answering the three daily questions and responding to market events.

## Core Daily Question Frameworks

### 1. Market Movement Analysis Framework (Q1: Why is BTC/ETH up/down?)

#### Event Hierarchy Assessment
Prioritize market drivers by impact level:

**Tier 1 - Macro Events (Highest Impact)**
- Federal Reserve decisions (rate changes, QE/QT)
- Major regulatory announcements (ETF approvals, bans)
- Banking/financial crisis events
- Geopolitical shocks (wars, sanctions)
- Dollar strength shifts (DXY breakouts)

**Tier 2 - Crypto-Specific Events**
- Major exchange issues (hacks, insolvency)
- Protocol failures or exploits
- Whale movements (>1000 BTC)
- Institutional announcements
- Network upgrades or forks

**Tier 3 - Market Structure**
- Technical breakouts/breakdowns
- Options expiry (monthly/quarterly)
- Funding rate extremes
- Liquidation cascades
- Seasonal patterns

#### Macro Event Impact Matrix
```
Event Type         | BTC Impact | ETH Impact | Alt Impact | Timeframe
-------------------|------------|------------|------------|----------
Fed Rate Hike      | -3 to -7%  | -5 to -10% | -10 to -20%| 24-48h
Fed Rate Cut       | +3 to +8%  | +5 to +12% | +10 to +25%| 24-48h
Banking Crisis     | ±10-20%    | ±10-20%    | ±15-30%    | 1-7 days
ETF Approval       | +5 to +15% | +3 to +10% | +5 to +15% | 1-3 days
Major Hack         | -5 to -15% | -5 to -15% | -10 to -25%| 6-24h
Regulatory Ban     | -10 to -30%| -10 to -30%| -20 to -40%| 1-3 days
```

#### Economic Indicators & Crypto Response
```
Indicator          | Reading        | Crypto Response | Reasoning
-------------------|----------------|-----------------|----------
CPI (Inflation)    | > Expected     | Negative        | Fed hawkish
                   | < Expected     | Positive        | Fed dovish
Unemployment       | Rising         | Mixed           | Recession fear vs Fed pivot hope
                   | Falling        | Positive        | Risk-on environment
DXY (Dollar)       | > 105          | Negative        | Strong dollar pressure
                   | < 100          | Positive        | Weak dollar boost
10Y Treasury       | > 4.5%         | Negative        | Opportunity cost
                   | < 3.5%         | Positive        | Search for yield
VIX                | > 25           | Negative        | Risk-off contagion
                   | < 15           | Positive        | Risk appetite
```

### 2. Portfolio Decision Framework (Q2: Should I keep/buy/sell?)

#### Market Regime Recognition
```

Early Bull     | MA20>50, RSI 50-60            | ACCUMULATE | ACCUMULATE | SELECTIVE
Choppy/Crab    | MAs flat, RSI 45-55           | HOLD       | HOLD       | REDUCE
Early Bear     | MA20<50, RSI 40-50            | REDUCE     | REDUCE     | EXIT WEAK
Strong Bear    | MA20<50<200, RSI<40           | EXIT/HEDGE | EXIT/HEDGE | MINIMAL
Capitulation   | RSI<30, Max fear, Vol spike   | BUY FEAR   | BUY FEAR   | WAIT
```

#### Macro-Driven Position Adjustments
```

Recession Confirmed        | Defensive positioning     | Risk-off environment
Inflation Spike            | BTC as hedge consideration| Store of value narrative
```

2. **Dollar/Rates**: DXY level, 10Y yield, futures implied rates
3. **Crisis Scan**: Bank news, exchange issues, hacks
4. **Technical Levels**: BTC/ETH support/resistance, funding rates
5. **Sentiment Check**: Fear/Greed index, options skew
6. **Volume Analysis**: Unusual activity, whale movements

### Event Impact Assessment
```
IF macro_event_today:
    Priority = MAXIMUM
    Focus = Event outcome scenarios
ELIF technical_breakout/breakdown:
    Priority = HIGH
    Focus = Volume confirmation
ELIF sentiment_extreme:
    Priority = MEDIUM
    Focus = Contrarian setup
ELSE:
    Priority = NORMAL
    Focus = Trend continuation
```

- **Monthly**: Options expiry volatility (last Friday)
- **Weekly**: Weekend gaps (thin liquidity)
