# Checklist Results Report

**Requirements Validation:**
- ✅ All functional requirements addressable through agent definitions and tasks
- ✅ Non-functional requirements achievable with proposed architecture
- ✅ BMad framework provides needed flexibility and modularity
- ✅ Existing tools significantly reduce implementation effort

**Technical Feasibility:**
- ✅ Agent loader pattern proven in BMad implementations
- ✅ Task-driven workflows reduce code complexity
- ✅ Template-based outputs ensure consistency
- ✅ JavaScript/Express/LangChain.js stack is mature
- ✅ Direct use of existing JS tools - no wrapping needed

**Risk Assessment:**
- ⚠️ Agent differentiation requires careful persona crafting
- ⚠️ Performance targets need optimization focus
- ⚠️ LLM costs need monitoring at scale
- ✅ Mitigation: Start with core agents, optimize prompts, implement caching
- ✅ Mitigation: Reuse existing tools reduces technical risk
