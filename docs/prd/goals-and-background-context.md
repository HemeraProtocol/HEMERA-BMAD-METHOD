# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Enable individual investors to make institutional-quality crypto investment decisions through multi-agent AI committee analysis
- Answer three daily critical questions: market movement reasons, portfolio decisions, and emerging opportunities
- Reduce research time by 90% while improving decision confidence by 40%
- Beat single-LLM providers (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) by 20% across all evaluation dimensions
- Create scalable framework for adding specialist agents as crypto market evolves

## Background Context
Individual crypto investors lose money due to emotional decisions, information overload, and lack of diverse perspectives. Current solutions (trading bots, single AI tools, human advisors) fail to provide the balanced, multi-perspective analysis that institutional investment committees offer. This PRD defines requirements for a Personal Crypto Investment Committee system that democratizes institutional-grade analysis through specialized AI agents working collaboratively.
