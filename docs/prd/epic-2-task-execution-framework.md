# Epic 2: Task Execution Framework

**Goal:** Implement task-driven workflow system for committee operations

## Story 2.1: Build Task Executor (Leveraging Existing Patterns)
As a system, I want to execute workflows defined in task markdown files,
so that committee behavior is configurable.

**Implementation Approach - Reuse Existing Patterns:**
- **Extend DependencyResolver** pattern for task resolution
- **Use existing markdown parsing** patterns from agent loader
- **Leverage file-manager.js** for task file operations
- **Apply module-manager.js** pattern for dynamic task loading

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Task executor follows existing BMad task structure patterns
2. Reuses markdown parsing utilities from tools/lib
3. Executes phases in defined sequence
4. Manages agent responses and state using existing patterns

## Story 2.2: Create Committee Meeting Task
As a user, I want structured investment committee meetings,
so that I get comprehensive multi-perspective analysis.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. investment-committee-meeting.md with 7-phase workflow
2. Phases: activation → analysis → round table → debate → validation → consensus → verdict
3. Proper agent interaction patterns (stakeholder round table, red team challenges)
4. JSON output structure matching phases
5. Completes in <5 minutes

## Story 2.3: Implement Daily Analysis Task
As a user, I want automated analysis of three daily questions,
so that I get consistent market insights.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. daily-market-analysis.md with question-specific logic
2. Contextual agent activation based on market conditions
3. Pre-computation scheduling support
4. Structured output for each question
5. <30 second execution time
