# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt
"Review the crypto investment committee chatbot API design focused on delivering three daily questions through multi-agent discussion. The system is backend-only with structured JSON responses. Consider how future frontends might best visualize agent debates and consensus building."

## Architect Prompt
"Design the technical implementation for a JavaScript-native crypto investment committee system that extends existing BMad infrastructure. Use markdown-defined agents, task-driven workflows, and template-based outputs. Leverage existing tools from tools/lib and tools/installer/lib. Focus on the agent executor extending ConfigLoader, CommitteeOrchestrator for meeting coordination, and Express.js API layer. The system must support dynamic agent activation, 7-phase committee meetings, LangChain.js integration, and <30 second responses for daily questions."
