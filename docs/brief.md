# Project Brief: Personal Crypto Investment Committee

## Executive Summary

A multi-agent AI system that simulates a personal crypto investment committee, leveraging the BMad Method's investment committee agent expansion pack. The system features multiple specialized AI agents, each with unique personas and expertise areas, working collaboratively to analyze cryptocurrency investment opportunities, assess risks, and provide balanced investment recommendations. This mimics the decision-making dynamics of a professional investment committee while being accessible as a personal advisory tool.

## Problem Statement

Individual crypto investors face significant challenges in making informed investment decisions due to the complex, volatile, and rapidly evolving nature of the cryptocurrency market. Current problems include:

- **Information Overload:** The crypto space generates massive amounts of data, news, and analysis that overwhelm individual investors
- **Lack of Diverse Perspectives:** Solo investors miss the balanced viewpoints that institutional investment committees provide through multiple expert opinions
- **Emotional Decision-Making:** Without structured analysis frameworks, investors often make fear or greed-driven decisions leading to poor outcomes
- **Technical Complexity:** Evaluating crypto projects requires understanding of technology, tokenomics, market dynamics, and regulatory landscapes - expertise rarely possessed by a single individual
- **Time Constraints:** Proper due diligence requires significant time investment that most individuals cannot afford

Existing solutions like trading bots focus on execution rather than advisory, while human financial advisors often lack crypto expertise. Solo research tools provide data but not the collaborative analysis and debate that leads to well-rounded investment decisions. The absence of a personal investment committee structure leaves individual investors vulnerable to biased, incomplete analysis.

## Proposed Solution

The Personal Crypto Investment Committee system creates a virtual boardroom where specialized AI agents collaborate to provide comprehensive investment analysis. The solution includes:

**Core Concept:** Multiple AI agents with distinct personas (e.g., Technical Analyst, Risk Manager, DeFi Specialist, Macro Economist, Regulatory Expert) engage in structured discussions about crypto investment opportunities. Each agent brings unique expertise and perspective, creating a balanced decision-making process.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Multi-perspective Analysis:** Unlike single AI tools, our committee structure ensures diverse viewpoints and healthy skepticism
- **Conversational Dynamics:** Agents can challenge each other's assumptions, creating deeper analysis through simulated debate
- **Personalized Committee:** Users can configure their committee composition based on their investment style and risk tolerance
- **Transparent Reasoning:** Each agent explains their position, allowing users to understand the full reasoning behind recommendations

**Why This Succeeds:** By simulating the collaborative intelligence of an investment committee, the system combines the processing power of AI with the decision-making framework that has proven successful in institutional investing. Users get the benefit of multiple expert perspectives without the cost or complexity of assembling a human advisory team.

**High-level Vision:** A personal AI advisory board that democratizes institutional-grade crypto investment analysis, making every investor capable of committee-level decision making.
